# State Environments

The term _state environment_, or just _environment_, was used within the
Terraform 0.9 releases to refer to the idea of having multiple distinct,
named states associated with a single configuration directory.

This mechanism no longer has a special noun associated with it, and instead
we refer to it just as [multiple states](multiple.html).
